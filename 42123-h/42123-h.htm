<p class="hanging">SCENE.&mdash;<i>Library in the Templeton home, a comfortable old-fashioned
room, reflecting its owner's love for the antique. A door at <span class="smcap">r.</span> leads
into the hall; another door <span class="smcap">l.</span>, opens into an adjoining room. For
furniture, a large desk strewn with books and papers, several easy
chairs, and shelves containing books. The room is decorated with
pieces of old china, dignified candlesticks, and various
old-fashioned articles. In a prominent position on the mantel is a
quaint silver teapot.</i></p>

<p class="hanging2">(<i>As the curtain rises, <span class="smcap">Mr. Horace Templeton</span> is seated at his desk
writing, surrounded by several ponderous reference books. <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Templeton</span> enters <span class="smcap">l.</span>, carrying a large basket packed with cast-off
clothing</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>setting basket on floor near door <span class="smcap">r.</span></i>). Hilda! (<i>Goes to <span class="smcap">l.</span></i>)
Hilda! Horace, have you seen&mdash;&mdash;? (<i>In despair.</i>) Oh, it's of no use.
Sue! (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Sue, l.</span></i>) Sue, have you seen anything of Hilda?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sue.</span> She came in here after dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>looking out <span class="smcap">r.</span></i>). She must have gone out, for her wraps are
not in the hall. How unfortunate!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sue.</span> She will be at home presently. (<i>Looks at basket.</i>) I wouldn't
leave that basket there, Celia. If&mdash;if Professor Gates should happen to
call this evening he would surely stumble over it; the dear man is so
near-sighted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>moving basket from door</i>). It's only a few things that I've
collected for poor Mrs. McLaffety. She's to send her boy for them. Did
Professor Gates tell you that he was coming this evening?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sue</span> (<i>moving about nervously</i>). Why, no&mdash;doesn't he usually call on
Tuesday evenings?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>sitting down</i>). Yes; and on Wednesday evenings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> and Thursday
evenings and Friday&mdash;I declare, I'm so worried about Hilda that I can't
keep track of anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sue</span> (<i>in surprise</i>). Hilda?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Yes, Hilda. For weeks she has not been herself. I know that she
has something on her mind, but I can't find out what it is. Her father
is no help&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Sound of door-bell.</i>) I'm sure that's the evening paper;
will you kindly get it, Sue? (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Sue, r. Mrs. T.</span> rises hurriedly and
goes to desk</i>.) Horace. (<i>Pause.</i>) Horace!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> (<i>without looking up</i>). Yes, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>in exasperation</i>). Will you give me your attention one moment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> (<i>impatiently pushing aside his work</i>). Celia, how many times
must I tell you that I'm preparing an article for the press, entitled,
"The Philosophy of our Forefathers as Revealed by their Kitchen
Utensils," and that I cannot endure this constant interruption?
(<i>Resumes work.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> You shall listen to me. Do you ever wonder at the increasing
frequency with which Professor Gates calls here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> (<i>impatiently</i>). Well, Gates is a good fellow&mdash;fine family&mdash;most
distinguished&mdash;that sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Very true, and moreover, he is in love with Hilda.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Nonsense! He's twice her age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> That doesn't matter. Hilda is old for her years; besides, she's
in love with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> You must be mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>emphatically</i>). I am not. Didn't you hear me telling Sue that
Hilda is unhappy, moody, incomprehensible? Those are symptoms&mdash;trust me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> I'm trying to determine your attitude toward this marriage.</p>

<p class="center">(<i><span class="smcap">Sue</span> appears unnoticed in door <span class="smcap">r.</span>, the paper in her hand</i>.)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> (<i>irritably</i>). You speak as if it were a settled thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> It is&mdash;practically.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Well, all I have to say is, if Professor Gates marries Hilda,
they shall have the teapot.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Resumes work. <span class="smcap">Sue</span> gives a little cry</i>.)
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>turning violently</i>). Sue, you frightened me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sue.</span> You were speaking of Hilda's marriage?</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Lays newspaper on desk. Sits down.</i>)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Yes; we have the prospect of seeing her settled most
comfortably.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sue</span> (<i>in agitation</i>). I wouldn't&mdash;you mustn't&mdash;she's too young.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>sitting down and picking up the newspaper</i>). Not at all.
(<i>Glances through paper.</i>) Of course, since you've never married, you
naturally think&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Springs from her chair.</i>) For heaven's sake,
Horace, the Wentworths were robbed last night of a thousand dollars'
worth of silver!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> (<i>rising hastily and seizing paper</i>). It can't be possible. Let
me see!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>weakly</i>). Burglars!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sue.</span> It's the third robbery on this street within a week!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> (<i>gloomily</i>). We shall be the next victims, I am confident. Oh,
why have I not carried the teapot to the safe deposit vault?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). The teapot? I think that we have other articles
quite as valuable as the teapot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> (<i>pacing the floor in great agitation</i>). Celia, are you crazy?
Consider that teapot, which graced the tables of the English nobility in
the seventeenth century when tea was first introduced into Europe, which
passed into the hands of the Puritans in Cromwell's time, and was
brought to this country in 1680, and which has been in our family for
over two hundred years! Why, it's worth its weight ten times over in
gold! (<i>Picks up teapot and examines it lovingly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> I'm sure that no burglar would ever want it. My rings are
another matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sue.</span> We'll have to sit up all night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> (<i>replacing teapot on mantel</i>). This shall not stay in the house
another day. Fool that I have been to keep it so long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> I'm more anxious about Hilda&mdash;out we know not where, and bandits
on every corner. (<i>Noise without.</i>) Ah, here she is now. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">r.,
Hilda</span> and <span class="smcap">Prof. Algernon Gates</span> in street costumes, the latter
perceptibly agitated</i>.) Hilda, I'm so relieved that you have come.
Good-evening, Professor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prof. G.</span> (<i>bowing nervously to every one</i>). Good-evening. Oh, my dear
Mrs. Templeton, such a painful experience for poor Miss Hilda!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> What has happened?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Some one please explain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prof. G.</span> (<i>sinking into a chair near <span class="smcap">Sue</span></i>). A most horrible fright!
(<i>Mops his forehead.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> I command you, Hilda, to tell me where you have been.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilda</span> (<i>excitedly removing her wraps and tossing them and her purse in
different parts of the room</i>). Such an adventure, mother. I was crossing
Elm Street in the shadow of the station, when a horrible man brushed
against me, and, before I could prevent him, grabbed my purse, and was
endeavoring to tear my watch from my waist&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Mercy on us, has the child been robbed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span> He would have gotten away in a moment, had not a tall gentleman
suddenly appeared from somewhere, who seized the ruffian and held him
until the officer that my screams had summoned arrived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Then what did you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span> The strange gentleman had just offered to escort me home, when we
met Professor Gates, who was kind enough to take me under his
protection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> But your rescuer, child? To whom are you indebted?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span> I was so excited that I quite forgot to ask his name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prof. G.</span> An unpardonable oversight on our part, Mrs. Templeton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> That is unfortunate! The whole affair is most horrible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span> Horrible? I think it's splendid!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> Splendid?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span> It was an adventure. I'd never had one before; and, mother, he
was so handsome!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> The robber?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span> No, no, the man who caught him. He was so big and
masterful&mdash;quite the most attractive man that I have ever seen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>glancing apprehensively at <span class="smcap">Prof. G.</span></i>). Hush, dear, hush. You
are all unstrung. You must lie down for a few moments. (<i>Draws <span class="smcap">Hilda</span>
toward <span class="smcap">l.</span></i>) You'll excuse us, Professor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prof. G.</span> Certainly. (<i>Rises affably</i>). I trust that our dear young lady
will suffer no ill effects from this experience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Sue, will you please bring Hilda's wraps?</p>

<p class="center">(<i><span class="smcap">Sue</span> rises and gathers up <span class="smcap">Hilda's</span> belongings. Exeunt

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prof. G.</span> A most remarkable young woman&mdash;Miss Templeton&mdash;marvelous
self-control.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> (<i>sitting down at desk and looking longingly at his work</i>). True,
and a most alarming occurrence. Hilda shall not go out alone again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prof. G.</span> (<i>moving about nervously</i>). You cannot be too careful. And now,
Mr. Templeton (<i>pausing by desk and clearing throat several times</i>),
there is something&mdash;in fact&mdash;I must explain&mdash;to be brief, I love Miss
Templeton. If it meets with your approval, I shall be most happy to make
her my wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Well, well, Mrs. Templeton has hinted at this. But, my dear
Professor, have you thought of the disparity in ages?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prof. G.</span> (<i>delightedly</i>). Considering the marked congeniality of our
tastes, that is hardly worth mentioning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> I fear she may prove reluctant&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prof. G.</span> (<i>beaming</i>). I have already ascertained her sentiments; she is
quite willing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> (<i>rising and extending his hand</i>). Then I am most happy to
connect my family with one so esteemed and ancient as your own; and, as
a further mark of my approval, I shall present you on your wedding day
with the Templeton teapot&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prof. G.</span> (<i>nervously</i>). Why, my dear sir, you quite overwhelm me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> As I have no sons, it is appropriate that you should own this
priceless heirloom (<i>taking teapot from mantel</i>) which, as you know,
belonged to the Duke of Birmingham when tea was first introduced into
England, passed into the hands of the Puritans in the time of Cromwell,
was brought to this country in&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mr. Leon Burnett, r.</span></i>) Why,
good-evening, Burnett.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> Good-evening, good-evening, Professor. I've come over to get
you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> (<i>pushing forward a chair</i>). Sit down, my friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>sitting down</i>). Haven't time, really. I just want you to come
over to inspect my new burglar alarm&mdash;my own invention&mdash;greatest device
of the century&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prof. G.</span> (<i>fidgeting about</i>). If you'll excuse me, I'll join the ladies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> (<i>smiling significantly</i>). Certainly, certainly, Professor.
<span class="float-right">[<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Prof. G., l.</span>, with alacrity.</i></span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>laughing</i>). Say, does he board over here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> (<i>sitting down</i>). No, that is&mdash;it's a state secret, Burnett, but
you are like one of the family; Gates is going to marry Hilda.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>springing up in surprise</i>). No?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Yes.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> He's too old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Oh, no, merely a dignified age for a girl so conservatively
reared as Hilda has been. She is much in advance of her years, I assure
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>pacing the floor thoughtfully</i>). I don't like it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> I think it a most suitable match, and I am intending to present

Eric&mdash;her brother, you know. By the way, we've just received a wire
saying that he was coming this evening. I don't know just what time to
expect him, for he comes and goes like a streak of lightning. I'll be
glad to bring him over and introduce him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Do, by all means. I know him well by reputation. His collection
of antiques is very valuable.</p>

leave it. He's never even been to see us since we moved here. But come

<p><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span> Hush! They do not know that I'm going. (<i>Goes to door <span class="smcap">l.</span> and

the teapot&mdash;that is, all that the teapot stands for: a family-tree,
prestige, that sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dean</span> (<i>incredulously</i>). The teapot?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilda.</span> Don't you know about our teapot? (<i>Takes teapot from mantel.</i>)
Here it is. (<i>Sarcastically.</i>) It belonged to somebody when tea was

<p class="center"><i>By J. Hartley Manners</i></p>

<p>Eight males, four females. Costumes modern; scenery, two interiors, not
difficult. Well suited for amateur performance. Plays a full evening.
This admirable play, made popular for two seasons by Mr. J. E. Dodson's
striking performance of its leading part, is offered for amateur
performance at a royalty of ten dollars. All the parts are strong and
exceptionally well contrasted. Of especial interest to Hebrew societies
from its able and sympathetic presentment of a man of their race.</p>

<h3>LOST&mdash;A CHAPERON</h3>

<p class="center">A Comedy in Three Acts</p>

<p class="center"><i>By Courtney Bruerton and W. S. Maulsby</i></p>

<p>Six male, nine female characters. Costumes modern; scenery, an interior
and an easy exterior. Plays a full evening. An excellent comedy with the
true college atmosphere but with its scenes away from actual college
life. A breezy lot of college girls in camp lose their chaperon for
twenty-four hours, and are provided by a camp of college boys across the
lake with plenty of excitement. The parts are all good and of almost
equal opportunity, the situations are very funny and the lines full of
laughs. This is sure to be liked by the young people for whom it is
intended, and is strongly recommended for high-school performance.
